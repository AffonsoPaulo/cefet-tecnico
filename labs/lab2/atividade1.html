            <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</strong><br>
            <em>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</em><br>
            <u>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</u><br>
            <span style="font-size: 2em;">It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</span><br>
            <small>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</small><br>
            Comparação <sup>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</sup><br>
            Comparação <sub>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.</sub></p>
